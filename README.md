# Financial Planner

## What is this project?
The Financial Planner website is a site aimed at encouraging young people between the ages of 15 and 21 to save, after getting their first job. The site allows users to input weekly expenses, weekly income and a financial goal, to provide them with the number of days they have until they reach that goal.
